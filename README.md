Here,i've shown how Convolution Neural netwroks can be implemented to check whether a plant leaf is diseased or is normal,here i've use the concepts of transfer learning,
I've used the VGG 16 Architecture in both the image prediction tecniques the dataset links for both the projects is shown below â†“
